# Folder `communications`

Responsible for all communication with the openHAB server.

This folder contains the connection management logic, HTTP request handling and persistence mechanisms required to keep the application state in sync with openHAB.

## Key Concepts

### Connection Mode

The app supports two connection modes: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) via the paired phone and direct Wi-Fi.

The BLE connection is effectively always on and allows regular polling of the sitemap, including state updates. In contrast, using Wi-Fi requires entering a dedicated Garmin sync mode. During this process, native Garmin system views are shown to indicate sync progress and completion.

Because of this limitation, no item states are displayed while operating in Wi-Fi mode. Commands can still be sent, but they are executed within the sync workflow. A manual sitemap refresh can also be triggered from the settings menu, though this updates only the sitemap structure and does not display live states.

The decision not to display states in Wi-Fi mode is intentional. State accuracy is critical, and showing potentially outdated or inconsistent information would be misleading. In particular, after sending a command there is no reliable way to predict possible side effects on related items. For example, switching on a light could affect a nearby group item. Without real-time updates, the UI might display inconsistent states. In such cases, it is preferable to show no state at all rather than an incorrect one.

See also the user manual’s [Network Access](https://next.openhab.org/docs/apps/garmin/#network-access) section for a user-facing explanation of this behavior.

### Sitemap Updates

Connect IQ does not support subscribing to sitemap updates from openHAB. Therefore, the app periodically polls the complete sitemap via a web request and rebuilds the menu structure based on the response.

The polling interval can be configured by the user in the app settings.

### Commands

Commands are sent using a dedicated command web request. This request is triggered by the menu items representing the corresponding sitemap elements.

## Folder Structure

### Subfolder `connection/`

Contains the `ConnectionManager`, which tracks the currently available connection type (BLE vs. Wi-Fi) and manages transitions between normal, degraded (Wi-Fi), and offline modes.

For more details on connection behavior, see the [Network Access](https://next.openhab.org/docs/apps/garmin/#network-access) section of the user manual.

### Subfolder `sync-delegates/`

Implements Wi-Fi-based synchronization used when no BLE connection is available.

Sync delegates are responsible for sending commands and updating the sitemap over Wi-Fi. They coordinate communication logic while delegating actual HTTP request execution to the `web-requests` package.

### Subfolder `web-requests/`

Implements communication with the openHAB server using the Connect IQ SDK’s `Toybox.Communications` module.

These requests are used for both BLE communication and Wi-Fi mode. In addition to sending and receiving data, this layer is responsible for processing server responses—for example, initializing a new sitemap and forwarding it to the user interface.

#### Folder Structure

- **`web-requests/base/`**  
  Contains `BaseRequest`, the abstract base class for all HTTP requests.  
  Provides shared functionality such as applying basic authentication and validating HTTP response codes.

- **`web-requests/command/`**  
  Implements requests for sending commands to openHAB.  
  Supports both:
  - The JSON-based REST API (available in openHAB 5 and backported to openHAB 4.3.x)
  - A custom webhook integration  

- **`web-requests/sitemap/`**  
  Handles sitemap retrieval, polling, and processing.  
  `SitemapRequest` periodically fetches sitemap data from openHAB and processes the retrieved JSON representation.
  To keep the UI responsive and avoid limitations such as the Watchdog timeout for long-running code and stack size restrictions caused by recursive processing, responses are processed asynchronously and non-recursively. The work is split into small tasks that are executed by the task queue implementation.
