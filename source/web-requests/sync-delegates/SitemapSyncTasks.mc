/*
 * This file defines all asynchronous task classes that are specific to sitemap updates
 * performed via the sync delegate over Wi-Fi.
 *
 * Most of the update process is handled by the standard tasks that process sitemap request
 * responses and create or update the HomepageMenu.
 *
 * These tasks adjust their behavior when running in sync mode. Since UI updates must not
 * be performed in sync mode, a StopSitemapSyncTask is queued instead. This task ends sync
 * mode and schedules a PostSitemapSyncTask, which restarts the sitemap request that was
 * paused when sync mode was entered and updates the UI.
