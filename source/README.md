# Folder `/source`

The app is written in **Monkey C**, Garmin's programming language, using the Connect IQ SDK API for UI, settings, persistent storage, and HTTP requests to openHAB.

**Annotations:**

- `(:glance)` is used to identify code that needs to be available in the *Glance*.
- Use of exclude annotations helps the build system tailor the code to each device (see the `monkey.jungle` file in the [root folder](../README.md#root-folder-) for details).

**Key files and directories:**

TODO: describe source code, link to subdirectories
